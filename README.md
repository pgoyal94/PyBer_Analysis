# An Analysis of PyBer App Data
Performing analysis on ride-share app data to help V. Isualize improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Overview of the Project
In this analysis, we helped perform exploratory data analysis for PyBer - a ride-sharing app. We created visualizations to tell a compelling story about the following data: 
1. The relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers 
2. The relationship between the type of city and the number of riders
3. The percentage of total fares by type of city
4. The percentage of total riders by type of city
5. The percentage of total drivers by type of city
6. Total weekly fares by type of city

## Results

1. Rural cities have fewer drivers and total rides as compared to suburban and urban cities.
    - Based on the above summary DataFrame, we'll notice that the total number of rides in the rural cities is about 13 and 5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.
    - The total number of drivers in rural cities is 31.8 to 6.3 times less than in urban and suburban cities, respectively. 
2. Rides is rural cities are more expensive for the rider and more profitable for the driver, per ride.
    - The average fare per ride a rider pays in the rural cities is $10 and $4 higher that urban and suburban cities, respectively.
    - The average fare drivers earn in rural cities is 3.3 to 1.4 times more per ride than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.
3. The overall volume of rides (based on total fares) in urban cities is 2 to over 9 times greater than is suburban and rual cities, respectively.

4. Based on the above chart, for dates between 01/01/2019 and 04/28/2019, the fluctuations in fare were fairly consistent regardless of city type (e.g. all lines spike around the end of February).
5. All of the lines, though they fluctuate, never cross and maintain a somewhat stable fare across the shown time.
